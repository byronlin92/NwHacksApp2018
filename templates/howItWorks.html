<h1 style="text-align:center; margin-bottom:40pt;">Let Our Service Reach You</h1>

<p>Our service aims to connect you with service work or repairs that you might require at your home, without
having to go through the long, expensive routes of having to obtain a professional service.</p>

<p>There are many ordinary individuals in your community who have the skills and expertise to handle some of your
housekeeping and maintenance needs. Our service allows you to connect with these people based on your location,
and furthermore ensures that the people we connect you with are verified in their field of work.</p>

<p>Our application opens with a view of your surroundings, showing you the various services and people available
nearby. Through our booking service, you will be able to connect with these people and continue with the
scheduling of their work. Payments and labour laws must be followed, and can be made in person to the service attendee.
</p>

<p>
